# AoC2024
My solutions to a majority of the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, completed in Python.

I completed these individually alongside a couple close friends as a form of timed competition between ourselves. I stopped working on them after the friends who I were working with refused to continue working on them, as I took priority on working other projects instead.
